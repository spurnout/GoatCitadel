## Tracking Table

| Asset ID | Type | Runtime Path | Source Asset Path | Source URL | Author | License | License URL | Attribution Required | Exact Attribution Text | Downloaded At (UTC) | Modified | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| central-operator | 3D model | apps/mission-control/public/assets/office/models/central-operator.glb | assets/source/office/central-operator/runtime-source-male/ | https://quaternius.itch.io/universal-base-characters | Quaternius | CC0 | https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ | No | n/a | 2026-03-07 | Yes: copied the selected `Superhero_Male_FullBody` source subset into `assets/source/office/central-operator/runtime-source-male/` and exported the shipped single-file GLB with embedded textures. | Shipped Office operator model. Source asset is from Universal Base Characters[Standard]; runtime currently uses the body-only male operator variant for the central Goatherder station. |
| goat-subagent | 3D model | apps/mission-control/public/assets/office/models/goat-subagent.glb | assets/source/office/goat-subagent/ | https://skfb.ly/osEZ8 | hendrikReyneke | CC BY 4.0 | http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ | Yes | "Goat" (https://skfb.ly/osEZ8) by hendrikReyneke is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). | 2026-03-06 | Yes: renamed to `goat-subagent.glb`; runtime keeps the embedded-texture GLB only; loose extracted textures moved out of `public`. | Shipped Office goat model. GLB validates as glTF v2 with embedded textures and no animation track. |
| goat-subagent-animated | 3D model | apps/mission-control/public/assets/office/models/goat-subagent-animated.glb | assets/source/office/goat-subagent-animated/ | https://skfb.ly/pGW7u | 3D_Tech | CC BY 4.0 | http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ | Yes | "Animated Goat: 2 Texture Variants (Free Asset)" (https://skfb.ly/pGW7u) by 3D_Tech is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). | 2026-03-07 | Yes: runtime GLB imported as `goat-subagent-animated.glb`; manifest now prefers it ahead of the static fallback goat. | Shipped Office animated goat model. GLB hash `C730D6D84193D10D566064856240CE97D6319D5D98CABEF5800408DADA06BAAA`; JSON chunk reports 4 idle clips (`DeformationSystem|IDLE_01_LOOP`, `DeformationSystem|IDLE_02_LOOP`, `DeformationSystem.001|IDLE_01_LOOP`, `DeformationSystem.001|IDLE_02_LOOP`). |
| office-kit-quaternius-modular-scifi-megakit | 3D model subset | apps/mission-control/public/assets/office/kits/quaternius-modular-scifi-megakit/ | assets/source/office/quaternius-modular-scifi-megakit/ | https://quaternius.itch.io/modular-scifi-megakit | Quaternius | CC0 | https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ | No | n/a | 2026-03-07 | Yes: copied the runtime subset into `public/assets/office/kits`; patched shipped glTF image URIs to `../Textures/*` so browser loading resolves shared textures. | Shipped environment subset for Office V5: `Platform_DarkPlates`, `WallAstra_Straight_Flat`, `WallAstra_Straight_Flat_Window`, `Column_Round`, `Prop_Light_Wide`, `Prop_AccessPoint`, and `Prop_Computer` with only referenced textures. |
| office-kit-quaternius-scifi-essentials | 3D model subset | apps/mission-control/public/assets/office/kits/quaternius-scifi-essentials-kit/ | assets/source/office/quaternius-scifi-essentials-kit/ | https://quaternius.itch.io/sci-fi-essentials-kit | Quaternius | CC0 | https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ | No | n/a | 2026-03-07 | Yes: copied only the runtime office subset and supporting textures into `public/assets/office/kits`. | Shipped furniture subset for Office V5: `Prop_Desk_Medium`, `Prop_Desk_L`, `Prop_Chair`, `Prop_Locker`, `Prop_Shelves_WideTall`, `Prop_Crate_Large`, and `Prop_Mug`. |

Full license text stored in `assets/source/fonts/rajdhani/OFL.txt`. |

## Office Asset Source Targets

Tier 1: preferred because the licensing is clearly compatible with repo redistribution.

1. Quaternius  
   Character and environment packs with CC0 licensing on the pack pages. Best current goatherder targets:
   - Universal Base Characters
   - Ultimate Modular Men Pack
2. Kenney  
   CC0 packs with broad prop and environment coverage.
3. Poly Haven  
   CC0 HDRIs, textures, and models.
4. ambientCG  
   CC0 textures, HDRIs, and models.

Tier 2: allowed only when the individual asset explicitly matches the repo policy and attribution burden is acceptable.

5. Sketchfab  
   Only use assets explicitly licensed under CC BY 4.0 or CC0, and record full attribution before shipping.
6. Poly Pizza  
   Mixed-license catalog. Use only after verifying that the exact asset is CC0 and not a different Creative Commons variant.

## Verification Rules

1. Do not ship an asset unless its license is explicitly CC0/Public Domain or CC BY 4.0. Bundled fonts may additionally use SIL Open Font License 1.1 when the full license text ships alongside the font files.
2. Every CC BY asset must record creator, source URL, license URL, exact attribution text, modification notes, and download date before commit.
3. If any asset license, source, or provenance is unclear, do not ship it.
4. Procedural fallback meshes must remain available to avoid license lock-in.
5. Keep raw archives and extracted source files outside `public/`; only runtime-needed files belong in the shipped asset tree.
