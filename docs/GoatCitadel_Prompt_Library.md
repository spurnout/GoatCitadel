# GoatCitadel: “What Can I Do With This?” (Use Cases + Prompt Library)

Welcome to GoatCitadel. If you’ve never used agentic AI before, this page is your on-ramp: copy a prompt, paste it, get a win, repeat. 🐐🏰

## TL;DR: How to Ask (Works for 90% of things)

Use this template:

**Goal:** what you want  
**Context:** what you’re working with (links, text, files, environment)  
**Constraints:** time, budget, tone, “don’t change X”, etc.  
**Output:** checklist, table, draft, script, plan, etc.  
**Workflow:** “Plan first, then execute.”

Example:
> Goal: Fix a service that won’t load behind my reverse proxy.  
> Context: Docker on Windows, Traefik, subdomain routing. Logs below.  
> Constraints: No breaking changes. Use PowerShell commands only.  
> Output: Step-by-step diagnosis + minimal config patch.  
> Workflow: Plan first, then execute.

## How to AI in GoatCitadel (15-minute onboarding)

If you are brand new to AI or agent systems, follow this exact flow once:

1. Pick one tiny goal you can finish today.
2. Paste this starter prompt:

```text
Goal: [one clear outcome]
Context: [what I already have]
Constraints: [time/budget/safety limits]
Output: [checklist/table/draft]
Workflow: Plan first, then execute after my go-ahead.
```

3. If the answer is vague, ask:

```text
Make this concrete.
Give me exact next 3 actions, each with done criteria.
If anything is blocked, tell me what you need from me.
```

4. If tools are blocked, use:

```text
Do not guess.
List constraints, what you tried, and the minimum input needed to continue.
```

5. Save good prompts into Prompt Lab and re-run after changes.

### Beginner Mistake-Proofing

- Include your exact goal and constraints every time.
- Ask for a format (`checklist`, `table`, `SOP`, `email draft`) so output is usable.
- Never paste secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords).
- Ask for rollback steps before infra/config changes.
- If quality is low, ask for role-labeled output (`Product -> Architect -> Coder -> QA -> Ops`).

## Pick a “Role” (Optional, but fun)

These “roles” are just mental presets. Use them in prompts like:  
**“Act as the Mechanic…”** or **“Be my Producer…”**

- 📚 **Librarian**: organize, summarize, extract, structure knowledge
- 🛠️ **Mechanic**: troubleshoot, debug, diagnose, propose fixes safely
- 🎬 **Producer**: plan projects, timelines, deliverables, messaging
- 🔎 **Researcher**: compare options, gather evidence, recommend
- 🎲 **GM Mode**: worldbuilding, NPCs, encounters, campaign tooling

# How to Integrate Into GoatCitadel UI

This section is meant for Codex to implement the experience inside GoatCitadel.

## UI Concept: Prompt Cards + Filters + Copy Button

### Suggested UI layout
- **Header**: “What can GoatCitadel do?” + search bar
- **Tabs**: Beginner | Intermediate | Power
- **Role chips**: Librarian | Mechanic | Producer | Researcher | GM Mode
- **Category filters**: Personal | Work | Tech | Creativity | Learning
- **Prompt cards**: title, 1-line description, tags, “Copy Prompt”, “Customize”
- **Customization drawer**: fill-in fields for placeholders like `[goal]`, `[constraints]`, `[paste logs]`

### Prompt Card schema (suggested)
```json id="4u57c1"
{
  "id": "tech.troubleshoot.ps_only",
  "title": "Troubleshoot an Error (PowerShell Only)",
  "level": "Beginner",
  "role": ["Mechanic"],
  "category": ["Tech"],
  "tags": ["logs", "diagnosis", "safe-changes"],
  "estimated_time": "10-20m",
  "prompt_template": "I’m seeing this error:\n[paste logs]\n\nAsk up to 3 diagnostic questions max...\n",
  "placeholders": [
    { "key": "paste_logs", "label": "Paste logs", "type": "multiline" }
  ],
  "outputs": ["Diagnosis plan", "Commands to run", "Minimal fix first", "Rollback steps"],
  "safety": ["plan_first", "no_secrets", "rollback_required"]
}
```

## Recommended product behaviors
- **“Plan First” toggle** (default ON for Tech + Scripts)
- **“PowerShell Only” toggle** (sticky user preference)
- **“Use my environment defaults”** (Docker/Traefik/Windows style assumptions)
- **Prompt enhancement**: automatically inject user preferences (tone, OS, tooling) into the prompt
- **One-click examples**: “Show me a filled example” for each prompt

## Onboarding flow (simple)
1) Ask: “What are you here for today?” (Work / Tech / Personal / Creative)
2) Show 6 starter cards
3) After first success: offer “Save as a reusable template”

---

# Expansion Instructions for Codex (Generate More Use Cases)

When generating additional prompts:
- Keep each prompt **copy-pastable** and beginner-friendly.
- Add tags, level, role, and expected outputs.
- Prefer templates with placeholders like `[goal]`, `[context]`, `[constraints]`.
- Include variations tuned for:
  - Work (support/success ops)
  - Tech (Docker, reverse proxy, automation)
  - Creative (worldbuilding + writing)
  - Learning (explain, drill, quiz)
- Add at least:
  - 20 more “Beginner Quick Wins”
  - 15 more “Tech + Automation”
  - 15 more “Work + Messaging”
  - 10 more “GM Mode”

# GoatCitadel Agentic Usage Mini-Playbook

## Single-role vs multi-role prompting

- Single-role: fastest when you only need one kind of output.
- Multi-role: use when you need cross-checks (requirements -> design -> implementation -> validation).

### Single-role template

```text
Do not spawn multiple agents.
Act as [role].
Goal: [goal]
Context: [context]
Constraints: [constraints]
Output: [format]
```

### Multi-role template

```text
Route this in order: Product -> Architect -> Coder -> QA -> Ops.
Goal: [goal]
Constraints: [constraints]
Require role-labeled sections in order.
If any role is blocked, include Constraints + Workarounds + Next input needed.
```

## Approval-safe prompting

```text
Before any risky action, stop for approval.
Give me: risk summary, blast radius, rollback, and smallest safe step first.
```

## Tool-blocked fallback prompt

```text
If tools are blocked or unavailable, do not guess.
Return:
1) What failed
2) What you did instead
3) Exact input needed from me
```

## Prompt Lab iteration loop

1. Draft prompt.
2. Run benchmark subset first.
3. Fix weak sections (routing/honesty/handoff/robustness/usability).
4. Re-run full pack only after subset is stable.
